                Petroleum trading and logistics play a big role in the global energy industry. From the moment oil is extracted, it needs to be transported, stored, and sold across countries and continents. But this process can also harm the environment if not done carefully. That’s why <strong>sustainability</strong>  is now a key focus.
            </p>
            <p class="article-intro">
                Sustainable practices in petroleum trading and logistics mean making sure that energy operations are safe, clean, and efficient while also protecting the planet and people.

                    Petroleum trading involves a lot of energy use. Companies are:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <li>Measuring their carbon footprint and setting reduction targets.</li>
                    <li>Using renewable energy at warehouses, offices, and terminals.</li>
                    <li>Offsetting emissions through carbon credits or tree planting.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>5. Training and Ethics</h3>
